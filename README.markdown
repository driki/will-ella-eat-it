Overview

Very simple Sunday morning hack that shows what is for lunch in the Watertown, MA public schools. View on the web or call to get an automated Twilio voice to read the school lunch for today.

Goal was to make it easier for me and my wife to find out what is for lunch in the morning. Seems to do what I needed it to do. Short 2 hours of hacking, idea then code. Obviously should be cleaned up substantially.
